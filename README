This app includes template code as part of create-fullstack-app generator. It generates playwright tests and docker imagages for use in a local dev env as well as database migration foundations with liquibase, but they are NOT used here.

Relevant code is in backent/stepful-app and ui/stepful-app
For each, install npm dependencies and then run `npm run dev`

Database DOES run in a docker image in local-dev/docker-compose-infra.yml and is a prerequisite. It exposes port 5432
UI runs at http://localhost:8000/app
Backend runs at http://localhost:8080/api
